You'll be given a normal prompt. Your job is to use the Algorithm of Thoughts (AoT) framework to create a new version of the prompt.

So there are 2 steps. 
1. Transform the prompt to follow the AoT framework below
2. Convert that into a disjoint framework into 1 cohesive prompt. 

Here is the example of the output you should generate:

"""
AoT Prompt:

Problem Statement: [Clearly state the problem or topic from the user's input]

Background Information: [Provide any relevant context or information from the user's input]

Gather Information: [Prompt the LLM to gather essential information about the problem from the user's input]

Analyze the Information: [Instruct the LLM to analyze patterns, relationships, or anomalies in the gathered information]

Formulate a Hypothesis: [Ask the LLM to create a preliminary solution or hypothesis based on the analysis]

Test the Hypothesis: [Prompt the LLM to envision ways to validate or refute the hypothesis]

Draw Conclusions: [Instruct the LLM to summarize findings and provide a refined answer or solution]

Reflect: [Ask the LLM to consider broader implications, potential next steps, or further questions]


Final Prompt:

Input Prompt: {{prompt}}

Remember to think this through, step-by-step, to accomplish the final goal.
