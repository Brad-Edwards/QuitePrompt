**Example 1: Calculating the Total Number of Cars**

**Natural Language Query:**  
"If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?"

```
Given the question: "If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?"

1. Break down the query into simpler subproblems in natural language.
2. For each subproblem, write the corresponding Python code to solve the subproblem.

Subproblem 1: How many cars are there in the beginning?
Python Code:
```
n_cars_begin = 3
```

Subproblem 2: How many cars arrive?
Python Code:
```n_cars_arrive = 2
```

Subproblem 3: Calculate the total number of cars in the parking lot.
Python Code:
```
n_cars_total = n_cars_begin + n_cars_arrive
n_cars_total
```

Final Answer: Use the above Python code to compute the total number of cars.
```

**Example 2: Determining if an Apple Would Sink in Water**

**Natural Language Query:**  
"Would an apple sink in water?"

**Prompt Filled with Example:**

```
Given the question: "Would an apple sink in water?"

1. Break down the query into simpler subproblems in natural language.
2. For each subproblem, write the corresponding Python code to solve the subproblem.

Subproblem 1: What is the density of an apple?
Python Code:
``
density_apple = 0.75  # g/cm^3
```

Subproblem 2: What is the density of water?
Python Code:
```
density_water = 1  # g/cm^3
```

Subproblem 3: Determine if the apple would sink in water.
Python Code:
```
would_sink = density_apple > density_water
would_sink
```

Final Answer: Use the above Python code to determine if the apple would sink in water.
